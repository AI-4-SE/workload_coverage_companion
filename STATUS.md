# 1 Badges

We apply appy for the following two badges and state 
our justification below.

## 1.1 Artifacts Evaluated - REUSABLE
The material and software included in this archive a) allow for reproduction of our analyses and findings (e.g., by using the interactive dashboard provided) and, b) contribute data sets for further empirical research and evaluating approaches to feature location and performance prediction.

## 1.2 Artifacts Available - AVAILABLE
We make public all measurements and workloads (experiment data) used in the study via an archived repository such that it can be used in further research. In addition, the authors provide an interactive dashboard that enables reenacting the analyses from the study. As the paper presents only a representative subset of the material available, this dashboard  complements the presentation of the study.
